I created the die model in Inkscape 0.92 using a youtube tutorial.  To reduce the size of the output it was exported as plain SVG, id's were then hand edited and some new groups added along with general tidy up then it was put through an online optimizer which removed and changed elements/numerics to make a slightly smaller file.
